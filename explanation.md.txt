##Understanding DFS for Maze Solving

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking. In the context of maze solving, this means we start from a starting point and move in a specific direction until we reach a dead-end or the goal. If we hit a dead-end, we backtrack to the previous point and try another direction.

##Implementation in Python

Here's a Python implementation of DFS for maze solving:
Python

def dfs(maze, start, end):
    """
    Solves a maze using Depth-First Search.

    Args:
        maze: A 2D list representing the maze.
        start: A tuple (row, col) representing the start position.
        end: A tuple (row, col) representing the end position.

    Returns:
        A boolean indicating whether a path was found.
    """

    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

    def dfs_util(row, col):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or maze[row][col] == 0 or visited[row][col]:
            return False

        visited[row][col] = True

        if (row, col) == end:
            return True

        # Explore all four directions
        if dfs_util(row - 1, col) or dfs_util(row + 1, col) or dfs_util(row, col - 1) or dfs_util(row, col + 1):
            return True

        return False

    return dfs_util(start[0], start[1])

# Example usage
maze = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

start = (0, 0)
end = (3, 4)

if dfs(maze, start, end):
    print("Path found")
else:
    print("Path not found")

Use code with caution.

##Explanation:

    Maze Representation: The maze is represented as a 2D list. 1 indicates a free cell, and 0 indicates a wall.
    Visited Matrix: A 2D boolean matrix visited is used to keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.
    DFS Utility Function:
        Checks if the current cell is valid (within bounds, not a wall, and not visited).
        Marks the current cell as visited.
        If the current cell is the end, returns True.
        Recursively explores all four directions (up, down, left, right).
        If any of the recursive calls returns True, a path is found, so the current function also returns True.
    Main Function: Calls the dfs_util function with the starting position and checks the returned value to determine if a path exists.

##Key Points:

    DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack.
    For more complex mazes, consider using backtracking to find the optimal path.
    DFS can be inefficient for large mazes, so other algorithms like A* search might be more suitable.
